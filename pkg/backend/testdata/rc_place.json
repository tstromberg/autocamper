The island is also alive with history. Three thousand years ago the island was a fishing and hunting site for Coastal Miwok Indians.  It was later a haven for Spanish explorer Juan de Ayala, a cattle ranch, and a U.S. Army post. From 1910 to 1940, the island processed thousands of immigrants.  During World War II, Japanese and German POWs were held on the island, which was also used as a jumping-off point for American soldiers returning from the Pacific. In the '50s and '60s, the island was home to a Nike missile base. Today, there are two active Coast Guard stations - at Point Blunt and Point Stuart - on the island. Angel Island became a State Park in 1958.",

On a clear day, visitors can see the Farallon Islands 25 miles out to sea, the Marin County Hills, San Francisco and the Bay, hills and cities of the East Bay, and Mount Diablo. On rare occasions, the Sierra Nevada's snow-covered mountains can be seen 150 miles away. Coastal Miwok Indians lived in the area for thousands of years before Europeans arrived. In 1770, two explorers named the mountain La Sierra de Nuestro Padre de San Francisco, which was later changed to the Miwok word Tamalpais. With the Gold Rush of 1849, San Francisco grew; and more people began to use Mount Tamalpais for recreation. Trails were developed, and a wagon road was built. Later, a railway was completed and became known as the Crookedest Railroad in the World It was abandoned in 1930 after a wildfire damaged the line.",

The park features exce hiking and rock climbing opportunities. The mountain was formed when a mass of underlying rock was gradually forced up through the earth's surface so, unlike other mountains, older and older rocks are encountered as you climb the mountain. The mountain was regarded as sacred to Native Americans.",
